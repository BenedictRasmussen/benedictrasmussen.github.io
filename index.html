        <p class="lead">About me</p>
		<p>I've was born and raised in Omaha. Through highschool I performed in music and drama before heading to Madison, SD to attend Dakota State University begin my career in computers.
        At the time, I was unsure what I wanted to major in and I bounced from Network Administration, to Network Security, to Information Sciences. Eventually, I left
        Madison and return to Omaha to attend UNO. I spent one year studying vocal music until I couldn't stand the gnawing feeling anymore- I had to learn more about
        software development. After learning my GenEd credits transferred but not my Comp Sci credits, I started back at square one in Java (having only learned C and 
        Assembly up to that point.)
         <p>
         In May of 2014 I was offered a position as a Software Engineer Intern at (formerly) Solutionary, now NTT Security. After one year, I was offered a full time position
         with the company, which I happily accepted. At the current time, I work fulltime as a Software Engineer 1 with NTT Security while slowly working towards my 
         Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
         
		<p class="lead">What you might not know about me</p>
		<p>As my title says, I also dabble in the outdoors and general fitness. I love to run, and will be participating (note: I did not say competing!) in the Omaha Marathon
        in the middle of September. I recently purchased a bike and have found that I greatly enjoy trail riding, my favorite track being Tranquility at 120 and Maple. These 
        things aside, I love to rock climb. I have climbed in Arkansas, Minnesota, South Dakota, Colorado, and bits and pieces of the southwest. My greatest achievement
        of my outdoor activities (and my second greatest achievement of all, losing only to my engagement with an amazing women) was summitting Mount Rainier in 
        Washington in August of 2016. Quite unlike some of the other 14,000 foot peaks in the lower 48 states, it requires an arsenal of mountaineering skills and 
        equipment to safely and successfully summit. In the picture is my fiance and myself standing at the summit of Rainier.</p>
		<p class="lead"> What really interests me</p>
		<p>I like to pull in topics to my lectures that interest you. I can't do that unless you tell me what interests you </p>
		<p>You MUST have a picture of yourself (I haven't memorized all your names yet).</div>
